/**
 * This class extends normal Java properties by adding the possibility
 * to use the same key many times concatenating the value strings instead
 * of overwriting them.
 *
 * <p>The Extended Properties syntax is explained here:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>each property has the syntax <code>key = value</code>
 *  <li>the <i>key</i> may use any character but the equal sign '='
 *  <li><i>value</i> may be separated on different lines if a backslash
 *      is placed at the end of the line that continues below.
 *  <li>if <i>value</i> is a list of strings, each token is separated
 *      by a comma ','
 *  <li>Commas in each token are escaped placing a backslash right before
 *      the comma.
 *  <li>if a <i>key<i> is used more than once, the values are appended
 *      like if they were on the same line separated with commas.
 *  <li>blank lines and lines starting with character '#' are skipped
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Here is an example of a valid extended properties file:<pre>
 *      # lines starting with # are comments
 *
 *      # This is the simplest property
 *      key = value
 *
 *      # A long property may be separated on multiple lines
 *      longvalue = aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa \
 *                  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 *
 *      # This is a property with many tokens
 *      tokens_on_a_line = first token, second token
 *
 *      # This sequence generates exactly the same result
 *      tokens_on_multiple_lines = first token
 *      tokens_on_multiple_lines = second token
 *
 *      # commas may be escaped in tokens
 *      commas.excaped = Hi\, what'up?
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE</b>: this class has <b>not</b> been written for performance
 * nor low memory usage. In fact, it's way slower than it could be and
 * generates too much memory garbage. But since performance it's not an
 * issue during intialization (and there no much time to improve it),
 * I wrote it this way. If you don't like it, go ahead and tune it up!
